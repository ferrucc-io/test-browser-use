# MCP server w/ Browser Use


> MCP server for [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use).

## Overview

This repository contains the server for the [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) library, which provides a powerful browser automation system that enables AI agents to interact with web browsers through natural language. The server is built on Anthropic's [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) and provides a seamless integration with the [browser-use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) library.

## Features

1. **Browser Control**

- Automated browser interactions via natural language
- Navigation, form filling, clicking, and scrolling capabilities
- Tab management and screenshot functionality
- Cookie and state management

2. **Agent System**

- Custom agent implementation in custom_agent.py
- Vision-based element detection
- Structured JSON responses for actions
- Message history management and summarization

3. **Configuration**

- Environment-based configuration for API keys and settings
- Chrome browser settings (debugging port, persistence)
- Model provider selection and parameters

## Development

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ferrucc-io/test-browser-use.git
cd test-browser-use
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

4. Configure environment variables:

```bash
cp sample.env.env .env
# Edit .env with your API keys (especially ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
# If you don't want to use a local Chrome instance, set:
# CHROME_PATH=  (leave it empty)
```

5. Start the server:

```bash
uv run mcp-browser-use
```

> **Note**: This project specifically requires browser-use==0.1.29. Using a different version may cause compatibility issues.

### Debugging

For debugging, use the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector):

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory /path/to/project run mcp-browser-use
```

The Inspector will display a URL for the debugging interface.

## Browser Actions

The server supports various browser actions through natural language:

- Navigation: Go to URLs, back/forward, refresh
- Interaction: Click, type, scroll, hover
- Forms: Fill forms, submit, select options
- State: Get page content, take screenshots
- Tabs: Create, close, switch between tabs
- Vision: Find elements by visual appearance
- Cookies & Storage: Manage browser state

## Security

I want to note that their are some Chrome settings that are set to allow for the browser to be controlled by the server. This is a security risk and should be used with caution. The server is not intended to be used in a production environment.
